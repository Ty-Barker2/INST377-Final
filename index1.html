                    This is a solo creation of Tyler Barker for the final of INST377 for the purpose of providing the information that could be used to solve the information problems that may arise from not having easy access to county spending data that is not too complicated for PG county for anyone who may have an interest in the financial history or future planning involving county spending.
                    <br>This project was born out of our desire to provide data and visualizations that can give insight into the state of spending by the local government. This project is the product of much effort and struggle whether it be with API implementation, or Visualization with a JavaScript library.
